## Updates

With game version 1.3.0 Paradox has introduced a number of new character traits; one of these is Engineer. This causes a conflict with the "Background: Engineer" trait in this mod so I've renamed it to "Background: Inventor" - it has the same modifiers but the description has changed slightly to reflect the new name.
